# Data
### Organisation
The main data can be downloaded from my Google Drive with the links below.
The directory structure should be organised as follows:
```bash
.../Tennis/
.../Tennis/data/
.../Tennis/data/annotations/
.../Tennis/data/commentary/
.../Tennis/data/frames/
.../Tennis/data/slices/
.../Tennis/data/splits/
.../Tennis/data/videos/
```

- [``frames/rgb``]() (coming soon) \[? GB\] (can be made using videos and code rather than downloaded)
- [``frames/flow``](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d587RcqnGSk4A5Tze7UpWMGgjHCvD5nx) \[40 GB\] - The cropped and resized optical flow frames

### About
- `annotations` stores `.json` files for each video generated by the
[annotator](../annotator/), as well as related annotator files.
- `commentary` stores `.txt` files for each split containing the
commentary sentences associated with their `point_id`.
- `frames` stores `.jpg` image files for `rgb` and `flow` frames for
each video in subdirectories.
- `slices` stores `.txt` slice files for each video that specify a
shortened temporal span for a match, removing the pre- and post-match
coverage.
- `splits` stores `.txt` files for each split (train, val, test).
- `videos` stores the original video files as `.mp4` files.
