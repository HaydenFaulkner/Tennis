# Data
### Organisation
The main data can be downloaded from my Google Drive with the links below.
The directory structure should be organised as follows:
```bash
.../Tennis/
.../Tennis/data/
.../Tennis/data/annotations/
.../Tennis/data/commentary/
.../Tennis/data/flow/
.../Tennis/data/frames/
.../Tennis/data/splits/
.../Tennis/data/videos/
```

### Download
You can download each of the sub-directories on my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pZZQO69OHVWZ-NQ1zyvNOBEB-2BcC08Q):
- [``annotations``](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12L0x6Is9f1eENP_84bMDbCVCd_K-2w9s) \[9.5 MB\] - The annotation files
- [``commentary``](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HZBQ-4hbR5o1vpT9oZI7rqINhn8FvgdU) \[1.7 MB\] - The commentary files
- [``splits``](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HZBQ-4hbR5o1vpT9oZI7rqINhn8FvgdU) \[36.3 MB\] - The splits
- [``videos``](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rGIJIwmp_jhB8eoW-KVNYKHlu56l5UAq) \[11.1 GB\] - The original videos

Due to the size of the `frames` and `flow` directories (217 GB each) these need to be generated with the `process.py` 
script. Please first download the [FlowNet](../models/vision/flownet) model before running this script 
([download here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AwUS8uBLc68j2jMc1dvC8XA4shJ_Amq0) and put in [/flownet/](../models/vision/flownet) 
directory).

### About
- `annotations` stores `.json` files for each video generated by the
[annotator](../annotator/), as well as related annotator files.
- `commentary` stores `.txt` files for each split containing the
commentary sentences associated with their `point_id`.
- `frames` stores `.jpg` image files for `rgb` and `flow` frames for
each video in subdirectories.
- `splits` stores `.txt` files for each split (train, val, test).
- `videos` stores the original video files as `.mp4` files.
