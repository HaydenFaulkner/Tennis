# Tennis (Work in progress)
Code supporting the paper:
["TenniSet: A Dataset for Dense Fine-Grained Event Recognition, Localisation and Description"](http://hf.id.au/papers/DICTA17_Tennis.pdf)

Code is being converted into [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/) and
[GluonCV](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/). With newly trained models
available soon.

***PLEASE NOTE:*** The results in the paper were with outdated Keras
models, new results will be presented below in this readme.


### The Data
See [data](/data/) for download and organisation information.


## About
### The Annotator

### The Data Processing
There are a number of processing files to extract and convert data. Descriptions of each files purpose can be found in the file header.

### The Models
Coming Soon - More information on the models can be found in the README in the models directory.
